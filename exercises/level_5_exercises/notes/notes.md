# INtro to REST API architecture

    # REST - Representational State Transfer (in simple terms, the endpoint should represent the piece of state that you are wanting to serve up, basically its intuitive  )

    # Resource - a single item (object) in a database e.g. a user, a post, a comment
        e.g. /user

    # Collection - A collection of similar items in a datbase e.g. all the users in a database, all the posts in a database
        e.g. /users

    # Base (root) URL - e.g. http://amazon.com/

    # API Endpoint - e.g. for getting a collection only:  http://amazon.com/movies e.g. for getting a single item: http://amazon.com/movies/12345

    # Parameters - e.g. /movies/movieID

    # Query (query string) - e.g. /movies?genre=action&year=2010

    # Client - Frontend
